    "description": "Communicating Change with Impact is a practical, engaging course designed to help change practitioners craft messages that truly land.Whether you’re leading Change efforts on a major transformation or supporting a small process shift, communication plays a central role in whether change succeeds — or falls flat. Yet too often, change comms are seen as an afterthought. They’re top-down, too technical, or just plain ignored.This course flips that on its head.You’ll learn how to create clear, human-centred communication that doesn’t just inform people — it moves them. That means messages that cut through the noise, resonate emotionally, build understanding, and drive real behaviour change.Grounded in a five-phase model — Hear it, Feel it, Understand it, Do it, Live it — the course walks you through the full communication journey. You’ll explore how to build awareness, create emotional connection, support action, and sustain momentum, long after go-live.Along the way, you’ll get practical tools you can use right away: comms plans, audience maps, message layering templates, and more. You’ll also see real-world examples of what works (and what doesn’t), and hear tips on how to keep your comms clear, focused, and human — even in complex environments.This course is built for real life. No jargon. No fluff. Just smart, flexible approaches you can tailor to your context, no matter the size or scope of your change.",

What do you want to accomplish? Having a specific goal in mind will help keep the meeting focused and productive. Develop a detailed agenda that outlines the topics to be discussed, the time allocated for each, and who will lead each discussion. Share the agenda with participants in advance so they can come prepared. Ensure that the right people are invited to the meeting. Only invite individuals whose presence and input are essential to achieving the meeting's objectives. Stick to the schedule. Begin and end the meeting on time. Use time management techniques to allocate appropriate time to each agenda item. Encourage participants to come prepared. This includes doing any necessary research, reviewing materials in advance, and having talking points ready. If you're the meeting facilitator, keep the discussion on track, manage time, and ensure everyone has an opportunity to speak. Encourage participation and maintain a respectful atmosphere. Encourage active listening among participants. This means truly paying attention to what others are saying and asking clarifying questions when needed. Create an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing their ideas and opinions. Avoid dominating the discussion if you're the meeting leader.  Visual aids like slides or charts can help clarify complex information and keep the meeting engaging. Just be mindful not to overuse them. Assign someone to take meeting minutes or notes. These notes should include action items, decisions made, and any follow-up tasks. Share these notes with participants after the meeting.",

    "description": "I have been teaching this course in the corporate environment for the past 17 years, and students are always amazed by how intuitive, simple, and fun learning Japanese can be.  I borrow from the methods I learned from over 20 years ago when I was called as missionary to Japan for 2 years.  Since that time I have lived in Japan a total of 3 years, and have interacted with Japanese customers and colleague for 20+ years in global business. I keep my course fun, engaging, and \"sticky\"...so that the learnings build on each other and stay with you through fun methods. There is no prerequisite for prior Japanese experience, just a desire to have fun and work hard.  Although this is part 3 of a 3 course series, so the 1st course is recommended.  All of the course materials are built into the presentation slide deck. The course is designed for those who are new to Japanese or who would like to take a refresher course learning in an all new style of learning;Japanese language: move from beginner to intermediate by utilizing unique methods I call the Japanese study \"cheat code\".  In particular Japanese conjugation is made simple through a unique method rarely taught in other Japanese language courses. By the end of the course you will be able to utilize 20 verb formulas!Japanese speaking: the class encourages learning Japanese systematically so that each student can build sentences on their own by the end of the course. Building sentences will feel much like building lego structures.Japanese Culture Training: Each section includes cultural keys to success and things to avoid from a Western perspective. I share many personal experiences which bring the culture tips to life.Japanese Biz tips: Pulling from 20+ working with Japanese customers in global business, I transfer this knowledge to each student.  Students will feel more confident and successful as they start to utilize these business secrets to success.Japanese “Headturners”: each section concludes with a high level, impressive Japanese phrases students can use to impress their Japanese friends.  These phrases include formal sayings, slang, and colloquial which can be used to turn heads from day 1.",

    "description": "*This course is originally in Japanese and uses English subtitles.Let me ask you this.Think of the people you interact with on a daily basis.What kind of people are they?Are they people who lead you to growth?Or are they people who drag you down?If you have a dream or a goal and are having trouble achieving it, maybe the situation will change if you learn communication and networking skills!Humans are unable to achieve greatness on their own.Behind every success story is the presence of networks and communication.However, when was the last time someone taught you in detail about communication and networks?Probably never.They don’t teach you in school and you don’t receive education on it.That’s why many people are unsure about communication.They use small “tricks” they find on the internet or in books. As a result, they worsen their relationships.You might not hear of networks a lot, but they’re far more important than many of you think.The theme of this course is to teach networking techniques using proper communication.By communicating not only with yourself but also with others, you will be able to grow together through synergy.The concepts taught in this course is not as simple as 1+1=2.If people with differing knowledge and thoughts come together to create new networks, 1+1 might equal 10 or even more.I understand firsthand the power of communication and networks.It can be said that the reason I exist today is because of communication and networks.The purpose of this course is to teach you the power of communication and networking to push you a little closer to achieving your dreams or goals.-You want to improve your communication abilities, but you don’t know where to start.-You can’t seem to communicate what you want.-You get nervous when speaking in front of people.-You don’t have a relationship built on trust with your colleagues or bosses.-You want to explain things well, but you can’t seem to do it.If any of the above apply to you and you blame yourself, don’t fret.You can construct networks with synergy from scratch.I started from scratch, too. In fact, I started below zero.If you learn through this course, you will be able to communicate with synergy and create networks.I firmly believe that you’ll be able to achieve your dreams and even change your life!I hope to see you in the course!*I sometimes receive messages saying, “This is obvious information.”The information I’m going to teach is very basic and practical. If you learn the basics, you can apply them to other things all you want. On the flip side, if you don’t know the basics, you won’t be able to apply anything. No matter how beautiful the house is, if the foundation is wobbly, you’ll never know when it’ll collapse. You won’t be able to design a great life without the foundation, even if you use fancy tricks.Use this opportunity to learn the basics!Furthermore, this course uses my experience and parts of it are deliberately abstract.It’s important to go into detail, but I also believe that each person has different situations and that it’s important to have a thought process that allows you to apply what you learn in your own issues and environments.If you feel that this course is not what you signed up for, I will refund you if it’s within 30 days of your purchase.Let’s make 2021 a great year with communication!",

    "description": "Course Description: Mastering Negotiation Through Fun, Role-Play & Real-World Scenarios.Do you find it difficult to negotiate? perhaps in normal life situations or at work? This course will equip you with the planning of  negotiating in a calm, professional and strategic manner, whether it's a sales negotiation, a salary negotiation, buying a house, business contracts or purchasing.Negotiation is a skill that impacts nearly every aspect of life. Whether you're negotiating a salary, closing a business deal, handling a customer complaint, or even deciding where to go on vacation with family, your ability to communicate and persuade can make all the difference. Yet, many people shy away from negotiation, seeing it as intimidating or confrontational. Others rely on instinct, not realizing that strategic negotiation techniques can give them a significant advantage.This course is designed to remove the fear and uncertainty from negotiation and replace it with confidence, strategy, and skill. Unlike traditional courses that focus on dry lectures and complex theories, this program takes a hands-on, interactive approach that makes learning fun, engaging, and immediately useful. Through a mix of animated scenarios, role-playing exercises, and real-world examples, you’ll see firsthand how different negotiation techniques play out in various situations—and most importantly, how to use them to your advantage.Learn by Watching, Doing, and PracticingNegotiation is not a one-size-fits-all skill. Different situations require different approaches, and the key to success is knowing how to adjust your style based on the situation and the person you’re negotiating with. That’s why this course covers the five primary negotiation styles—Competitive, Collaborative, Accommodating, Avoidant, and Compromising—and teaches you when and how to use each effectively.Rather than just reading about these styles, you will see them in action through engaging story-driven animations that bring each strategy to life. You’ll watch animated characters make mistakes and learn from them, as well as see strong negotiation strategies executed successfully. Then, you’ll step into the negotiator’s shoes yourself through role-playing exercises that help you build confidence and refine your skills in a variety of scenarios, such as:Salary negotiations – Learn how to ask for more, handle objections, and confidently secure the compensation you deserve.Business deals – Discover how to create value, overcome resistance, and close agreements that benefit both sides.Customer service challenges – Master de-escalation techniques and learn how to turn conflicts into positive resolutions.Everyday interactions – From negotiating a better price to settling disputes with coworkers, you’ll gain skills that help in daily life.Business competitive negotiations - The hard sale and seeing through false contracts.Compassionate negotiations - When a fair win win is best for the business and customer.What You’ll Experience in This CourseRole-Playing Exercises – Engage in realistic negotiation scenarios where you will practice persuasion, confidence, and strategic thinking.Animated, Story-Based Examples – Watch entertaining and easy-to-follow animations that illustrate negotiation techniques and styles in action.Real-World Applications – Gain strategies you can immediately use in business negotiations, leadership roles, customer interactions, and personal situations.Flexible, Self-Paced Learning – This course is designed for individual learners, allowing you to develop skills through practical, hands-on exercises without group discussions or quizzes.Why This Course WorksMany people believe that negotiation is only for business executives or high-powered salespeople, but the truth is, negotiation is a life skill that benefits everyone. When you learn how to negotiate effectively, you can:Achieve better outcomes in both professional and personal situations.Gain confidence in high-pressure conversations.Read the other party’s style and adapt accordingly.Strengthen relationships by negotiating in a way that builds trust and respect.By the end of this course, you will no longer feel uncertain or unprepared when faced with a negotiation. Instead, you will understand the dynamics at play, recognize the best strategy to use, and confidently lead negotiations toward successful outcomes.This is not just another negotiation course—it’s a transformative, immersive learning experience designed to make you a stronger, more confident negotiator. Are you ready to develop one of the most valuable skills for success in business and life? Let’s get started..",

I keep my course fun, engaging, and \"sticky\"...so that the learnings build on each other and stay with you through fun methods. There is no prerequisite for prior Japanese experience, just a desire to have fun and work hard.  Although this is part 2 of a 3 course series, so the 1st course is recommended.  All of the course materials are built into the presentation slide deck. The course is designed for those who are new to Japanese or who would like to take a refresher course learning in an all new style of learning;Japanese language: move from beginner to intermediate by utilizing unique methods I call the Japanese study \"cheat code\".  In particular Japanese conjugation is made simple through a unique method rarely taught in other Japanese language courses.Japanese speaking: the class encourages learning Japanese systematically so that each student can build sentences on their own by the end of the course. Building sentences will feel much like building lego structures.Japanese Culture Training: Each section includes cultural keys to success and things to avoid from a Western perspective. I share many personal experiences which bring the culture tips to life.Japanese Biz tips: Pulling from 20+ working with Japanese customers in global business, I transfer this knowledge to each student.  Students will feel more confident and successful as they start to utilize these business secrets to success.Japanese “Headturners”: each section concludes with a high level, impressive Japanese phrases students can use to impress their Japanese friends.  These phrases include formal sayings, slang, and colloquial which can be used to turn heads from day 1.",
