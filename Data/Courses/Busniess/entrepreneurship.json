A couple of years ago, I was trading my time for money just in order for me to able to pay rent at the end of the month and not end up homeless, while still putting myself through depression to finish my studies.It is a miserable situation to be financially free, where you can literally do anything you want and fly anywhere you want, whenever you have the urge to.Although freelancing is a great way to make money online, it is still not the best way out there.Getting paid $10 an hour through online income is still considered as a job, as you don't have the most valuable item in the world, which is time.Being wealthy doesn't mean having 1 million dollars in your bank account.Being wealthy means having the freedom to do whatever you want to do in your life without any obstacles.Having the skill to trade your time for money, also means that this skill can be monetized in a way, where you can achieve passive income and wake up on PayPal buzzing your phone informing you that you got yet another purchase.And if you think monetizing this skill needs a HUGE budget or more than 100k Instagram followers, then think again.You don't even need to spend any budget on ads and all of your traffic can come from totally organic reach.Let me tell you one thing, you just hit the jackpot.Introducing: Coursesy Course Creator!Coursesy Course Creator is an online course that will help you discover your hidden skill that you can monetize online by writing, outlining, designing, filming, editing, and publishing it as your own profitable online course. The step-by-step guide modules are shaped in a way to take you through a smooth transition from acquiring the entrepreneurial mentality and discovering you talent all the way to finalizing and scaling your online course to a passive income machine.We understand that although this course has everything you need to start your journey from point A to point B, it might not be for everyone.

    "description": "INTRODUCTION      \t   The Zero Cost Traffic Case Study course does not tell you how to get zero cost traffic it shows you through actual case studies step by step how to get the zero cost traffic you need for your site. YouTube is now the largest source of zero cost traffic on the internet and this course shows you how to raid YouTube for that traffic. This course is about principles and methods that work and the case studies use methods that still continue to work even though YouTube has moved the goal posts over and over again. If you want unlimited zero cost traffic to your site this is the course for you.      \t  These Zero Cost Traffic Case Studies are among the most detailed hands on training available to online marketers. This is not about hype but about tactics and principles that have worked in the past on YouTube and still work today. The concepts and principles of this course are timeless and the opportunities for success are greater than ever because the use of video is increasing year on year and today's marketers are so often not prepared to do the preparation work to ensure their long term success.      \t WHY WEBSITE TRAFFIC IS NECESSARY      \t   Traffic come in two forms paid and free. This course is about free unlimited ongoing traffic. Organic traffic and free traffic that comes in from the search engines - rather than traffic that is paid for with the likes of Google Adwords or Bing Ads.      \t    If you have the #1 position on Page 1 of Google for a keyword, then you'll get about 73% of the traffic that looks at that search results page. The lower down the page you are, the less traffic will come your way. So it's vital that you position highly for your keywords.      \t   Traditional methods work but it's a lot of work and it takes a considerable amount of time. Using these methods, a site can take anywhere from 1-3 months to gain any traction on the rankings.      \t THE BEAUTY OF THE ZERO COST TRAFFIC CASE STUDY      \t   Using video to promote your sites is much less labor intensive, is more time efficient and sees faster results in site rankings.      \t   This course does not teach you how to make videos - there are plenty of tools and courses that will teach that, it shows you how to turn those videos into a never ending stream of free traffic to your site.      \t   What the Zero Cost Traffic Case Study teaches is a specific strategy for ranking websites high in the search engines. But more than that, results happen quickly. While videos rank quickly, sometimes within just minutes of being uploaded, the ultimate goal is to get those videos to boost your website in the search engine rankings as well as driving traffic to your website.      \t   The result is that you can dominate a whole page in Google. That could mean your website and videos take the the top 8-10 positions on a search result page. And you know how powerful that would be!      \t   The Zero Cost Traffic Case Study is a video training course that shows you the easiest and best way to get your videos - and your website - to the first page of Google as quickly as possible. There are 6 Modules in the course:      \t Module 1: Strategy Walk Through  \t      \t   This outlines the strategy in this course that you will use to drive traffic to your websites. It contains 10 videos, total running time: 101 minutes.      \t Module 2: Backlink Building      \t   While this course is primarily about a specific YouTube strategy, getting links from other sites should also be part of your backlinking strategy. In this module, you'll be introduced to some backlinking strategies that not many use, yet they are some of the most powerful techniques you can use to raise the profile of your site.      \t   This module contains 7 videos, total running time: 72 minutes      \t Module 3: Keyword Research And Understanding Keywords      \t   Not a module to be skipped if you're already familiar with keyword research. Here you'll learn the right way to go about choosing keywords, why you choose those keywords and how the search engines learn your relationship with those keywords. Understanding how the search engines see your the relationship between your website and your keywords is crucial. You'll also discover how to use keywords the right way in promoting your website.      \t   This module contains 5 videos with a total running time of 60 minutes.      \t Module 4: Introducing The Case Study Website      \t   This course demonstrates how a particular website was promoted to gain high ranking in Google. That site is introduced in this module along with some specific SEO tweaks that are designed to maximize how Google sees the site.      \t   5 videos, total running time: 57 minutes.      \t Module 5: Case Studies      \t   In this module, several case studies are presented showing just how successful the Zero Cost Traffic Case Study strategy is boosting a site's ranking in Google and how Page #1 for a keyword can be dominated.      \t   7 videos, total running time: 154 minutes.      \t Module 6: Video Creation      \t   Many people are reticent about appearing in front of a camera in their own videos. While this is not a course on video creation, this module provides several ideas on how you can go about creating your own videos if you don't want to appear in camera or don't want to record using your own voice.      \t   There are 3 videos in this module with a running time of 45 minutes.      \t Module 7: Conclusion      \t   Summing up what you will have learned from taking this course.      \t   1 video; running time: 13 minutes.      \t WHAT THIS COURSE WILL DO FOR YOU      \t   You start with one video and create a butterfly effect that can displace the competition with devastating effect.      \t   And, rather than working against Google, as can happen with older SEO techniques, Google gets behind you because they own YouTube.      \t   Take this YouTube Training course now and learn how to dominate Google without the hassle and pain of using traditional backlinking methods",

    "description": "Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a difference in prices in two or more market- striking a combination of matching deals to capitalize on the difference, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded. when used by academics an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility to instantaneously buy something for a low price and sell for a higher price. Retail arbitrage involves purchasing products from brick- and-mortar retail stores at a discount and then reselling them on Amazon at a higher price. This strategy capitalizes on discrepancies in pricing between different marketplaces or clearance sales in physical stores. Online arbitrage follows a similar concept but takes place entirely on the internet. Sellers source products from various online retailers or e-commerce platforms at discounted prices and resell them on Amazon for a profit.  Online arbitrage is also relatively easy to start, as it can be done from the comfort of your own home. Begin by visiting online retailers and e-commerce platforms to search for discounted products. To save time and increase efficiency, you may consider using specialized online arbitrage tools such as tactical arbitrage, which can help you identify profitable deals across multiple websites.",

    "description": "If you want to make more money, to know what to do and take action on that knowledge. So much of what happens to us is because of how we think. You’ve probably heard of things like: raising your vibration; the power of visualization; and The Secret.Have you heard the word spizzerinctum? It means will to succeed, guts, nerve, backbone, energy. I shorten it to spiz. Successful people have spiz. You can too.You might be thinking, well I can’t achieve my goals through positive thinking alone. Some would disagree with you. In fact, I’ve seen $400 just magically show up in my bank account. That is not what this course is about.Let me ask you a question. Do you believe negative thinking can result in failure? Of course, right? If you didn’t believe you could do something, you wouldn’t even try. So negative thinking is a cause of failure because we don’t try. On the other hand, positive thinking is the cause of success because we don’t give up.Mindset is huge!! I’m going to give you an experience of controlling your mind. When I first had this experience, it changed my life. I couldn't believe it. My brain was often running out of control. Every day I’m going to have you practice the experience. You will learn to watch your thoughts. If you’re like me, you’ll find out why you don’t achieve your goals. For me, I prioritize my kids and my wife over money. How about you? You’ll learn. Once you see what you prioritize, then you must decide – do you want more money? Or is family and time off more important? My father once said, “I could make more money, but I’d have to work harder.” You could have both time and money if you structure your business differently.I want you to think of your brain as a bio supercomputer. When you have an experience, it is recorded in your brain. If you are like most chiropractors, you have no business programming. You don’t know about accounting, finance, business valuation, taxes, negotiation, and marketing. When you take the course, you create programs in your brain that you can use to improve your business. You develop a business mindset. You become a businessperson.By the end of the course, you’ll go through some exercises to help you realize what must happen to achieve your income goals. You’ll find it really isn’t that hard. Once you believe you can, you’ll have the energy and persistence to make it happen.I’m here to help. Ask me questions through the Udemy platform.I’m looking forward to hearing of your success.Robert Affolter, MBA, DC",

    "description": "When it comes to launching your startup idea, validation is key. Throughout this course, I'll guide you through the process of validating your concept with customers, a universally accepted best practice in the startup world. You'll learn the mechanics of validation, supported by insightful case studies to illustrate the principles in action.While some may point to outliers like Steve Jobs who succeeded without validation, the reality is that most ventures falter without it. Aspiring tech entrepreneurs, particularly those entrenched in coding and development, often overlook the importance of market input. However, proceeding without validation is akin to courting failure.In this course, I'll show you why validation is crucial, especially for tech startups. Whether you're targeting B2C or B2B markets, understanding customer needs and preferences is paramount. While some development may be necessary to test ideas, prioritizing validation over technology development is the key to success.Join me as we explore proven validation methodologies honed over 15 plus years in the 1Mby1M curriculum. By enrolling in this course, you'll gain access to battle-tested strategies that will set your startup on the path to success.

A couple of years ago, I was trading my time for money just in order for me to able to pay rent at the end of the month and not end up homeless, while still putting myself through depression to finish my studies.It is a miserable situation to be financially free, where you can literally do anything you want and fly anywhere you want, whenever you have the urge to.Although freelancing is a great way to make money online, it is still not the best way out there.Getting paid $10 an hour through online income is still considered as a job, as you don't have the most valuable item in the world, which is time.Being wealthy doesn't mean having 1 million dollars in your bank account.Being wealthy means having the freedom to do whatever you want to do in your life without any obstacles.Having the skill to trade your time for money, also means that this skill can be monetized in a way, where you can achieve passive income and wake up on PayPal buzzing your phone informing you that you got yet another purchase.And if you think monetizing this skill needs a HUGE budget or more than 100k Instagram followers, then think again.You don't even need to spend any budget on ads and all of your traffic can come from totally organic reach.Let me tell you one thing, you just hit the jackpot.Introducing: Coursesy Course Creator!Coursesy Course Creator is an online course that will help you discover your hidden skill that you can monetize online by writing, outlining, designing, filming, editing, and publishing it as your own profitable online course. The step-by-step guide modules are shaped in a way to take you through a smooth transition from acquiring the entrepreneurial mentality and discovering you talent all the way to finalizing and scaling your online course to a passive income machine.We understand that although this course has everything you need to start your journey from point A to point B, it might not be for everyone.

    "description": "Women receive less than 2.7 % of Venture Capital investments and it is time to change these numbers. Research shows that despite all gains in many fields, women still lag behind in growing businesses. Some claim investors are not recognizing that women develop firms differently, that they take fewer risks, that banks would not lend as much, but the reality is quite DIFFERENT. Women are less confident and less prepared to raise funds. This course was developed to overcome these two weaknesses. In particular you will:1. Become aware of your relationship with money.2. Evaluate and overcome, if necessary, any of the Ten Unwealthy Habits.3. Understand the financial world of business (also applicable to non-profits).4. Define your goals.5. Understand key financial concepts and funding mechanisms.6. Select the sources of funding that better fit your goals. 7. Establish a funding strategy.This course is structured in building blocks, so you can do as deep or superficial as you'd like. Browse through the mini-videos, read the supporting texts, revise your understanding or watch the interviews.Whether you are ready to raise funds, want to help others, learn the basics, we are here to help.If you are a consultant, contact us to create a program for your group.",
