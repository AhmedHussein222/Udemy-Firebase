    "description": "Web Development is the practice of developing websites and web apps that live on the internet.All websites use HTML . It’s a fundamental part of every web developer’s toolkit. HTML provides the content that gives web pages structure, by using elements and tags, you can add text, images, videos, forms, and more. Learning HTML basics is an important first step in your web development journey and an essential skill for front- and back-end developers.CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to style websites. Colors, fonts, and page layouts for a site can all be managed using CSS. JavaScript is a fun and flexible programming language. It’s one of the core technologies of web development and can be used on both the front-end and the back-end. While HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and colors to web pages, JavaScript makes them interactive and come alive.Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.Git is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects",

You will learn how to build components from scratch, and how you can combine these components to create complex interactive User Interfaces for your audience. For the duration of this course, we are going to use the more popular function components as opposed to class components.ReactJs is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.",

Over 55% of developers say they spend 10-20 hours a week fixing bugs instead of writing new code.

That's why I've put together this 13-lesson video mini-course that will feature an assortment of HTML, CSS, and JS bugs. You'll have both the opportunity to solve them on your own or simply watch how we can debug them together. We'll look at common bugs, uncommon bugs, and even some incredibly tricky JavaScript quirks!What's included:13 short video lessons, each investigating a different bugDebug a wide array of HTML, CSS, and JS bugsDifficulty ranges from easy to downright diabolicalMock \"GemWizard\" ecommerce website infested with bugs to bashFollow along with a cloned version of the site's repo or just watch!By the time you've finished the course, I'm sure you will have learned something you didn't know before. ?FAQWhat level of Web development knowledge should I have for this course?You'll need at least a basic/foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.What frameworks are used in this course?No frameworks!

It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.As per official Tailwind CSS documentation, Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that allows you to custom-build designs eliminating opinionated component styles that you would anyway want to override.Beautiful custom user interfaces can be effectively built using CSS without actually putting in much coding effort. Being a utility-first framework, Tailwind CSS renders the leverage of styling every component distinctively, the way you desire.Adapting the “form follow function”, the name of the utility class predicts the exact function of that class for ease in designing. Tailwind combines the most critical CSS properties which can be customized and extended according to project requirements.In this course, you will learn the following topicsTailwind Installation and SetupWorking with Tailwind CSS and Pure CSS parallellyColours, Heights, Widths , Margins , PaddingsFlexboxes and Alignments and PositionsAnimations, KeyframesMaking websites responsive without Media queries.",

    "description": "Welcome to the first-ever course on SFU in the internet  Mastering WebRTC: Build a Simple SFU from Scratch! — dedicated to teaching you how to build a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) from the ground up. Whether you’re just starting your journey into WebRTC or already have experience with real-time communication, this course is your perfect next step.Scaling WebRTC applications for multiple users is one of the biggest challenges developers face, and that’s where SFUs come into play. This course will not only demystify SFUs but also empower you to create scalable, high-performance communication platforms.What is an SFU, and Why Does It Matter?An SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) is a highly efficient architecture for real-time communication systems. It optimizes bandwidth and computational costs by selectively forwarding audio, video, or data streams to participants. SFUs are essential for applications that support multiple users, such as group video calls, live streaming, and more.Despite their importance, SFUs are rarely covered in-depth, making them a daunting topic for developers. That’s where this course stands out—it takes you from the basics to advanced SFU development, step by step, with practical, hands-on guidance.Why Should You Learn SFU Development?With SFU expertise, you’ll unlock opportunities to develop cutting-edge applications in industries such as:Video conferencing platforms like Zoom or Google Meet.Gaming applications requiring low-latency communication.Healthcare solutions for real-time diagnostics.Educational platforms for live virtual classrooms.Live streaming applications for events and marketing.SFUs are the gold standard for scalable WebRTC applications, and by mastering them, you’ll gain advanced skills that set you apart as a WebRTC developer.What Makes This Course Unique?This course is one-of-a-kind because it:Focuses on building an SFU from scratch—no shortcuts, no pre-built libraries.Offers hands-on, step-by-step guidance, making complex topics approachable.Covers real-world implementation, preparing you to build scalable WebRTC applications.Whether you’re new to SFUs or have prior WebRTC experience, this course bridges the gap between theory and practice.What You’ll LearnThe Fundamentals of WebRTC:Real-time communication concepts.Key differences between Mesh, MCU, and SFU architectures.Use cases and benefits of SFUs.Step-by-Step SFU Development:Setting up your server-side and frontend environments.Integrating WebRTC signaling and peer connections.Implementing ICE candidates and handling media tracks.Building and forwarding tracks for scalable communication.Advanced Features:Renegotiation for dynamic session updates.Efficiently forwarding tracks to new clients.Handling disconnections and user management.Project Completion:Putting it all together to build a fully functional SFU-powered application.Why Wait? Start Building Scalable Applications Today!By the end of this course, you’ll have the confidence and skills to build your own SFU media server and develop scalable, real-time communication applications. This is your chance to step into the advanced world of WebRTC development.Enroll now, and let’s build your first SFU together—one step at a time!",
