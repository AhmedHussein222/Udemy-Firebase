    "description": "Web Development is the practice of developing websites and web apps that live on the internet.All websites use HTML . It’s a fundamental part of every web developer’s toolkit. HTML provides the content that gives web pages structure, by using elements and tags, you can add text, images, videos, forms, and more. Learning HTML basics is an important first step in your web development journey and an essential skill for front- and back-end developers.CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to style websites. Colors, fonts, and page layouts for a site can all be managed using CSS. JavaScript is a fun and flexible programming language. It’s one of the core technologies of web development and can be used on both the front-end and the back-end. While HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and colors to web pages, JavaScript makes them interactive and come alive.Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.Git is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects",
